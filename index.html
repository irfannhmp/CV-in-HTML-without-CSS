                    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
                        HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. </p>
                        
                        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like < h1 > and < /h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example < img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
                        
                        <p><b><i>Extract:</i></b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                                <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
                                <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
                                <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
                                <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h2>What is an HTML Element?</h2>
                        <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:<br>
                        < tagname> Content goes here... < /tagname><br>
                        The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
                        </p>
            <table>
                <th>
                    <a href="CV-in-HTML-without-CSS.html"><dialog open>CLICK HERE<br>to view CV in HTML without using CSS</dialog></a>
                </th>                                
            </table>
